## Sprint Planning Directive

Automates the planning of sprints, including the selection and assignment of issues based on priorities and team capacity.

## Issue and Task Creation Directive

Facilitates the automatic creation of issues and tasks in JIRA from user stories and feature requests.

## Backlog Prioritization Directive

Employs AI to help prioritize the product backlog items based on factors like business value, dependencies, and effort.

## Burndown Chart Update Directive

Automatically updates and generates burndown charts to visualize sprint progress.

## Velocity Tracking Directive

Monitors the team's velocity and provides forecasts for future sprints based on historical data.

## Stand-up Meeting Automation Directive

Prepares daily stand-up items by summarizing task progress, identifying blockers, and alerting team members of their next priorities.

## Retrospective Insights Directive

Collects data on sprint performance, gathers team feedback, and generates insights for continuous improvement.

## JIRA Workflow Customization Directive

Tailors JIRA workflows to match the team's Agile processes, setting up automated transitions and triggers.

## Release Management Directive

Orchestrates build and deployment schedules, integrating with CI/CD pipelines and updating release information in JIRA.

## Risk Assessment Directive

Identifies potential risks or impediments to project deadlines and suggests mitigation strategies.

## Resource Allocation Directive

Analyzes team capacity and skillsets to automate resource allocation and reassignment as needed.

## Reporting and Analytics Directive

Generates custom reports on project metrics (e.g., completion rates, scope changes, quality indicators) for stakeholders.

## Implementation

The directives all need to be implemented and saved to the `docwriter` directory in the Astro codebase. The directives should be implemented in the following order:

1. Codebase Analysis
2. Comment Extraction and Interpretation
3. API Documentation
4. Code Example Generation
5. Markdown Conversion
6. Navigation Structure
7. Astro Integration
8. Starlight Feature Highlighting
9. Version Control Documentation
10. Accessibility and SEO Optimization
11. Automated Publishing
12. Feedback Loop
13. Documentation Update

Once the directives are created, this section ('Implementation') and its content should be removed from this document, and a new section should be added in its place, titled 'Execution'. The 'Execution' section should contain the following information:

* The name of the directive
* A link to the directive
