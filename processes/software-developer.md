## Code Standards Enforcement Directive

Automatically checks code against predefined coding standards and best practices, flagging deviations for correction.

## Reference-Based Comparison Directive

Compares code commits against a repository of reference implementations to ensure adherence to proven patterns and identify potential improvements.

## Inline Review and Annotation Directive

Provides real-time, in-line annotations on code during development, suggesting enhancements and alternatives based on context.

## Automated Quality Metrics Directive

Tracks and reports software quality metrics like complexity, maintainability, and test coverage, with thresholds set for triggering action items.

## Documentation Quality Check Directive

Verifies that inline documentation and code comments meet predefined standards for clarity and completeness.

## Security Vulnerability Scanning Directive

Integrates security scanning tools to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before code integration.

## Performance Profiling Directive

Profiles code to detect performance bottlenecks and suggests optimization strategies.

## Dependency Analysis Directive

Evaluates and manages project dependencies, alerting developers to version changes, deprecations, and compatibility issues.

## Code Duplication Detector Directive

Scans for and highlights duplicated code blocks, promoting modular design and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## Automated Testing and CI Integration Directive

Manages and triggers automated testing within continuous integration pipelines, with feedback loops for failed tests.

## Iterative Enhancement Directive

Suggests incremental enhancements for existing code based on new developments in the field and evolving project requirements.

## Peer Review Coordinator Directive

Organizes and streamlines the peer review process, assigning reviewers, tracking review progress, and consolidating feedback.

## Implementation

The directives all need to be implemented and saved to the `docwriter` directory in the Astro codebase. The directives should be implemented in the following order:

1. Codebase Analysis
2. Comment Extraction and Interpretation
3. API Documentation
4. Code Example Generation
5. Markdown Conversion
6. Navigation Structure
7. Astro Integration
8. Starlight Feature Highlighting
9. Version Control Documentation
10. Accessibility and SEO Optimization
11. Automated Publishing
12. Feedback Loop
13. Documentation Update

Once the directives are created, this section ('Implementation') and its content should be removed from this document, and a new section should be added in its place, titled 'Execution'. The 'Execution' section should contain the following information:

* The name of the directive
* A link to the directive
