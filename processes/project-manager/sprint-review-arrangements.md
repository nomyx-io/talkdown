### Talkdown Directives for Sprint Review Arrangements

1. **Work Item Aggregation**
   - `RetrieveCompletedWorkItems(sprintId)` - Get a list of all work items that have been marked as completed during the sprint.
   - `GenerateWorkItemsSummary(workItems)` - Create a summary or report that outlines the main points of the completed items.

2. **Sprint Review Meeting Schedule**
   - `ScheduleMeeting(meetingDetails)` - Set up the sprint review meeting in Microsoft Teams with all required participants.

3. **Agenda and Report Distribution**
   - `CreateAgenda(sprintGoals, completedWorkItems)` - Develop an agenda for the sprint review based on the sprint goals and the work that was completed.
   - `DistributeDocument(document, recipients, method)` - Share the sprint review agenda and any reports with the team and stakeholders through the chosen method (email via Outlook or posts in Microsoft Teams).

### Sequence of Operations for Sprint Review Arrangements

1. **Work Item Collection for Sprint Review**
   - Determine the `sprintId` that is coming to an end and ready for review.
   - Call `RetrieveCompletedWorkItems(sprintId)` to compile a list of items that were completed during the sprint.
   
2. **Creating Summary Reports for Sprint Review**
   - Use the list of `workItems` to call `GenerateWorkItemsSummary(workItems)` which will aggregate the accomplishments into a single, clear report or presentation.

3. **Scheduling the Sprint Review Meeting**
   - Define `meetingDetails` including time, date, participants, and the purpose of the meeting.
   - Call `ScheduleMeeting(meetingDetails)` to create an event in Microsoft Teams calendar for the sprint review.

4. **Preparing and Distributing Sprint Review Agenda**
   - Call `CreateAgenda(sprintGoals, completedWorkItems)` to generate a detailed agenda that will guide the sprint review meeting.
   - Identify the `recipients` who should receive the agenda and reports, including the development team and any relevant stakeholders.
   - Choose a method of distribution, `method`, which could be either 'email' or 'teams'.
   - Call `DistributeDocument(document, recipients, method)` to send out the agenda and summaries in preparation for the sprint review meeting.

By following these directives, the AI-driven project manager can automate the logistics of preparing for a sprint review meeting, ensuring that all necessary materials are ready and distributed on time, and the meeting is scheduled with all the required attendees. This process allows the team to focus more on reviewing the sprint outcomes and planning future iterations with better efficiency and preparedness.
