### Sequence of Operations for Automated Daily Stand-ups

1. **Initiating Daily Stand-up Meeting Schedule**
   - Define the `meetingDetails` object with the timing, participants, and recurrence details for the daily stand-up.
   - Call `ScheduleRecurringMeeting(meetingDetails)` to schedule the stand-up meeting in Teams.

2. **Sending Daily Reminders**
   - Get the `meetingId` for the upcoming stand-up meeting.
   - Call `SendMeetingReminder(meetingId)` to remind team members of the meeting.

3. **Collecting Daily Updates**
   - Call `CollectStatusUpdates(teamMembers)` at the start of each day or at a designated time before the stand-up meeting to gather updates from each team member.

4. **Aggregating Updates**
   - With the `updateResponses` collected, call `AggregateStatusUpdates(updateResponses)` to compile the updates into a summary format.

5. **Preparing and Distributing the Summary**
   - Call `GenerateSummaryReport(updateData)` to create a clean, formatted summary report from the aggregated updates.
   - Define the `distributionList` with the recipients who should receive the summary (usually the team members and possibly stakeholders).
   - Call `DistributeReport(report, distributionList)` to share the summary report via the preferred communication channel.

These directives will interact with Microsoft Teams for meeting scheduling, use Power Automate for reminders and status collection, and utilize an AI or scripting system for aggregating and formatting the updates into a report. The summary could be a simple text update or a more complex document that includes visual elements like charts or tables to encapsulate the team's progress visibly. These directives enable the seamless workflow of an automated daily stand-up without the need for manual gathering and reporting, thus improving productivity and focus for the team.
