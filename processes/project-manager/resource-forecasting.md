# Resource Forecasting

## Overview

The virtual project manager (VPM) will manage the resource forecasting within the project. This includes utilizing historical Azure Boards data to predict future resource needs and generating reports that assist in resource planning for upcoming sprints.

## Key Features

1. **Resource Prediction**
   - `PredictResourceNeeds(historicalData)` - Analyze historical data to predict future resource needs.
   - `GenerateResourceForecastReport(predictionData)` - Create a report based on the predicted resource needs.
2. **Resource Planning**
   - `PlanResourcesForSprint(sprintId, resourceForecast)` - Plan the resources for an upcoming sprint based on the resource forecast.
   - `UpdateResourcePlan(sprintId, resourcePlan)` - Update the resource plan for a specific sprint.

### Sequence of Operations for Resource Forecasting

1. **Predicting Resource Needs**
   - Continuously execute `PredictResourceNeeds(historicalData)` to predict future resource needs based on historical data.
   - Upon completion of the prediction, call `GenerateResourceForecastReport(predictionData)` to create a resource forecast report.
2. **Planning Resources**
   - For each upcoming sprint:
     - Use `PlanResourcesForSprint(sprintId, resourceForecast)` to plan the resources based on the resource forecast.
     - Call `UpdateResourcePlan(sprintId, resourcePlan)` to update the resource plan in Azure Boards.
