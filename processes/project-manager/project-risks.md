# Project Risks

## Overview

The virtual project manager (VPM) will identify and manage the potential risks within the project. This includes monitoring Azure Boards for project risks using analytics, sending Teams messages or emails when risks are identified with proposed mitigation strategies.

## Key Features

1. **Risk Identification**
   - `IdentifyRiskFromAnalytics(data)` - Analyze project data to identify potential risks.
   - `ClassifyRisk(riskDetails)` - Categorize the identified risk based on its potential impact and likelihood.
2. **Risk Notification**
   - `SendRiskNotification(recipient(s), message)` - Send a notification to one or more recipients about a newly identified risk.
   - `SubscribeToRiskUpdates(riskId)` - Enable automatic updates to specified risks.
   - `ConfigureRiskNotificationSettings(settings)` - Adjust the risk notification preferences and triggers within Azure Boards.
3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - `ProposeRiskMitigationStrategy(riskId)` - Suggest a mitigation strategy for the identified risk.
   - `ImplementRiskMitigationStrategy(strategyDetails)` - Execute the proposed risk mitigation strategy.

### Sequence of Operations for Project Risk Management

1. **Identifying Risks**
   - Continuously execute `IdentifyRiskFromAnalytics(data)` to look for potential risks within project data.
   - Upon detection of a potential risk, identify the `riskDetails` and call `ClassifyRisk(riskDetails)` to categorize the risk.
2. **Sending and Managing Risk Notifications**
   - For newly identified risks:
     - Use `SubscribeToRiskUpdates(riskId)` to enable automatic notifications.
     - Call `SendRiskNotification(recipient(s), message)` to inform the relevant stakeholders about the new risk.
   - Use `ConfigureRiskNotificationSettings(settings)` to ensure notifications are being sent according to user preferences.
3. **Mitigating Risks**
   - For each identified risk, call `ProposeRiskMitigationStrategy(riskId)` to suggest a mitigation strategy.
   - Upon approval of the strategy, call `ImplementRiskMitigationStrategy(strategyDetails)` to execute the risk mitigation strategy.
