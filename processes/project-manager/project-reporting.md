# Project Reporting

## Overview

The virtual project manager (VPM) will manage the project reporting. This includes generating various reports such as sprint reports, resource utilization reports, and project progress reports.

## Key Features

1. **Report Generation**
   - `GenerateSprintReport(sprintId)` - Create a report for a specific sprint.
   - `GenerateResourceUtilizationReport()` - Create a report that shows the utilization of resources.
   - `GenerateProjectProgressReport()` - Create a report that shows the progress of the project.
2. **Report Distribution**
   - `DistributeReport(recipient(s), report)` - Send a report to one or more recipients.
   - `ScheduleReportDistribution(schedule, recipient(s), reportType)` - Schedule the distribution of a specific type of report to one or more recipients.

### Sequence of Operations for Project Reporting

1. **Generating Reports**
   - At the end of each sprint, execute `GenerateSprintReport(sprintId)` to create a sprint report.
   - Periodically execute `GenerateResourceUtilizationReport()` and `GenerateProjectProgressReport()` to create resource utilization and project progress reports.
2. **Distributing Reports**
   - For each generated report:
     - Use `DistributeReport(recipient(s), report)` to send the report to the relevant stakeholders.
   - Use `ScheduleReportDistribution(schedule, recipient(s), reportType)` to schedule the distribution of reports.
