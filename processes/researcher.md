## Literature Review Directive

Automates the process of searching for, curating, and summarizing relevant academic papers and articles.

## Data Collection Automation Directive

Sets up automated systems for large-scale data harvesting from various sensors, databases, or online resources.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Directive

Performs initial data cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing to prepare data sets for analysis.

## Statistical Analysis Directive

Executes various statistical analysis tasks, interprets results, and creates visuals and reports.

## Experiment Design Support Directive

Helps researchers design experiments by suggesting methodologies, sample sizes, and control variables based on best practices.

## Simulation and Modeling Directive

Assists in setting up and running computational models and simulations according to researcher specifications.

## Hypothesis Generation Directive

Suggests potential hypotheses by identifying patterns and correlations within collected data.

## Academic Writing Directive

Aids in drafting research papers, abstracts, and other scholarly documents, ensuring adherence to publication standards.

## Reference Management Directive

Manages and organizes bibliographic information to streamline citation and ensure academic integrity.

## Peer Collaboration Directive

Facilitates collaboration with peers, coordinating document sharing, communication, and version control.

## Research Dissemination Directive

Assists in distributing research findings through relevant academic channels, conferences, journals, and social media.

## Continuous Learning Directive

Provides updates on recent developments in the field, new tools, and methodologies to enhance research practices.

## Implementation

The directives all need to be implemented and saved to the `docwriter` directory in the Astro codebase. The directives should be implemented in the following order:

1. Codebase Analysis
2. Comment Extraction and Interpretation
3. API Documentation
4. Code Example Generation
5. Markdown Conversion
6. Navigation Structure
7. Astro Integration
8. Starlight Feature Highlighting
9. Version Control Documentation
10. Accessibility and SEO Optimization
11. Automated Publishing
12. Feedback Loop
13. Documentation Update

Once the directives are created, this section ('Implementation') and its content should be removed from this document, and a new section should be added in its place, titled 'Execution'. The 'Execution' section should contain the following information:

* The name of the directive
* A link to the directive
