## Crisis Management Trigger Directive

## Implementation

The directives all need to be implemented and saved to the `docwriter` directory in the Astro codebase. The directives should be implemented in the following order:

1. Codebase Analysis
2. Comment Extraction and Interpretation
3. API Documentation
4. Code Example Generation
5. Markdown Conversion
6. Navigation Structure
7. Astro Integration
8. Starlight Feature Highlighting
9. Version Control Documentation
10. Accessibility and SEO Optimization
11. Automated Publishing
12. Feedback Loop
13. Documentation Update

Once the directives are created, this section ('Implementation') and its content should be removed from this document, and a new section should be added in its place, titled 'Execution'. The 'Execution' section should contain the following information:

* The name of the directive
* A link to the directive
