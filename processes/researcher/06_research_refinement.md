## Input

- Critique report from the self-review.
- Original models, simulations, and hypotheses.

## Task Execution

- Update and refine hypotheses.
- Improve mathematical models and Python simulations as suggested.
- Document the changes and rationale behind them.

## Output

- Refined hypotheses, updated models, and improved Python simulations.
- If you're done with your work, then output routing information: "Routing: 07_research_presentation.md"
- Otherwise output instructions to continue the work and end with routing information: "Routing: 06_research_refinement.md"

## Routing

Either: [Research Presentation](07_research_presentation.md) OR
        [Research Refinement](06_research_refinement.md)
