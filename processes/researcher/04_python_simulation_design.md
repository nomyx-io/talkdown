## Input

- Descriptions and formulas of the proposed mathematical models.

## Task Execution

- Script Python code to simulate each model computationally.
- Define parameters, set up simulation environments, and validate code functionality.

## Output

- Python scripts ready for simulation runs. Save the scripts in a folder named "simulations", naming the files after the corresponding models.
- If you're done with your work, then output routing information: "Routing: 05_self_review_and_critique.md"
- Otherwise output instructions to continue the work and end with routing information: "Routing: 04_python_simulation_design.md"

## Routing

Either: [Self-review and Critique](05_self_review_and_critique.md) OR
        [Python Simulation Design](04_python_simulation_design.md)
