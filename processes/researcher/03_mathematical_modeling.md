inputs: [hypothesis.md]
outputs: [mathematical_modeling.md]

## Input

- A list of hypotheses for which mathematical models are needed.

## Task Execution

- Define the scope and structure of the models based on the information from the hypotheses and literature review.
- Use computational techniques to create or extend the mathematical models.
- Document the assumptions, variables, and formulas of each model.

## Output

- Detailed descriptions of proposed models, including formulas, assumptions, and variables.
- If you're done with your work, then output routing information: "Routing: 04_python_simulation_design.md"
- Otherwise output instructions to create additional models and refine existing and elaborate on existing ones and end with routing information: "Routing: 03_mathematical_modeling.md"

## Routing

Either: [Python Simulation Design](04_python_simulation_design.md) OR
        [Mathematical Modeling](03_mathematical_modeling.md)
