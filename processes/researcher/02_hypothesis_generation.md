## Input

- Read the files in 'inputs' to find the literature review report.

## Task Execution

- Applying reasoning and inferential models to propose new scientific hypotheses.
- Outline the reasons and potential implications of each hypothesis.
- Include references to the literature review and analysis report.

## Output

- A list of formulated hypotheses ready for exploration and testing.
- If you are done with hypothesis generation, then end your output with routing information: "Routing: 03_mathematical_modeling.md"
- Otherwise end your output with routing information: "Routing: 02_hypothesis_generation.md" with instructions to generate additional hypotheses.

## Routing

Either: [Mathematical Modeling](03_mathematical_modeling.md) OR
        [Hypothesis Generation](02_hypothesis_generation.md)
