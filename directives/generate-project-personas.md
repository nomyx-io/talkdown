# Generate Project Personas and Roles

This directive is designed to assist in the identification and creation of personas and roles for a given project or product idea. Personas and roles provide a human-centered approach to understanding the needs and behaviors of users, which is crucial in designing intuitive and effective systems.

## Input

* `project_idea` - A brief description of the project or product idea
* `target_audience` - The intended users of the system

## Execution

1. Analyze the provided `project_idea` and `target_audience`.
2. Identify the different types of users that would interact with the system.
3. For each identified user type, create a persona. A persona should include demographics, motivations, behaviors, and any other relevant characteristics.
4. Identify the roles that each persona would play in the system. Consider what actions they would perform, what data they would need to access, and how they would interact with other users.
5. Document each persona and role in a structured format.

## Output

A list of personas and roles, where each entry contains:

* `persona_name` - The name of the persona
* `persona_description` - A description of the persona
* `role` - The role of the persona in the system
