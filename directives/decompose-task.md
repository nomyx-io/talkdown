This directive decomposes the given task into a list of smaller, more manageable tasks.

## Input

The directive expects the following inputs:

1. `task` - The task to decompose

## Execution

To execute, perform the following steps:

1. Identify the main objectives and sub-objectives of the task.
2. Break down the main objectives into smaller sub-tasks.
3. Prioritize the sub-tasks based on their dependencies and urgency.
4. Create a list of decomposed tasks.

## Output

The directive should output:

1. `decomposed_tasks` - A list of decomposed tasks with their respective orders. Each task should have a clear deadline and the amount of time needed to complete it.

## Examples

Here is an example of how this directive can be used:

- **Task**: Plan a holiday trip
  - **Decomposed Tasks**:
    1. Decide on the destination
    2. Book flights
    3. Book accommodation
    4. Plan daily activities
    5. Prepare a packing list
    6. Pack bags

Each decomposed task might have sub-tasks. For example, "Decide on the destination" might include research on different destinations, budgeting, checking weather conditions, etc.
